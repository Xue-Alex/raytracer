# Raytracer

Simple toy raytracer loosely inspired by [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#overview). Features anti-aliasing, gamma correction and is also multhreaded with OpenMP.

Run with `make` to create `raytracer` executable. Then run the executable, capturing output in a `ppm` file. Using any ppm to png viewer you can find the raytraced image.
